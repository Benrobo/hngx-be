# HNGX Backend Task 2

Stage Two Task
You are to build a simple REST API capable of CRUD operations on a "person" resource, interfacing with any database of your choice. Your API should dynamically handle parameters, such as adding or retrieving a person by name. Accompany the development with UML diagrams to represent your system's design and database structure. Create an automated testing script that verifies each of your API's operations. Host your entire project on GitHub, and provide a well-structured documentation in the repository that outlines request/response formats, setup instructions, and sample API usage.
